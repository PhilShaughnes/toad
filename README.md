This is an API for TOAD, a short message social network where users can post "croaks".

This project was a joint assignment between the front-end and back-end class at The Iron Yard. This code is JUST THE API. The front-end ought to be available at .

## Getting started

To get started, you will need to run `rails db:migrate`.

If you want to seed the database with fake data, you can run `rails db:seed`.

`db:seed`, unless edited, will ensure you have at least 10 users in the database. Each user will have a few posts and should have a few followers and followees. They also should have avatar photos. Each of these is easily changed in the `seeds.rb` file. Simply comment/uncomment the method you with to include/exclude.
